title: "nottshcverse: Development of tools to query and analyse healthcare data in R"
description: |
  ***TLTR:*** 
  Our goal was to make it easier for our team and other people to work with healthcare data in a reproducible and collaborative way.
  We started by formalising common and recurring analytical tasks using code so that they can be turned into functions and grouped into R packages.
  This allowed us to make use of many advantages that cannot be done easily using other approaches such as (1) good documentation of code and analytical tasks, (2) formal testing of code, (3) easy distribution of updates across across all analysists, and (4) modular integration of common data manipulations or analyses into interactive dashboards.
  This post describes our development of a new set of tools that redefine the way we analyse healthcare data -- it's open, reproducible, and fun!

Our team works with routinely collected NHS patient data.
Currently we focus on how patients are using the service, clinical outcome measures, and patient experiences.
The main questions that guide our work are *'What works for whom and how does it work?'*, *'What doesn't work?'*, and *'How can we integrate patient experiences into our analyses?'*. 
We developed a set of different tools to help us look at these questions by automating recurring and time-consuming tasks so that we can spend more time thinking about hard problems.

## The challange

PROBLEM!!!
<!-- We use scripts and notebooks and they are great. -->
<!-- But we want to make sure everyone uses the same methods so that work is comparable. -->
<!-- Developing these tools takes time, but if not now ... then when?  -->

<!-- This figure illustrates how our packages work together, the packages can be categories roughly like this: -->

<!-- - `nottshcData`, Specific, Access to databases (unified framework to load, transform, and aggregate data) -->
<!-- - `nottshcMethods`, specific (but also some general) tools that help us tidy shit up -->
<!-- - `honos`, `LSOApop`, packages that are designed in a very generic way that help our `nottshcData` package tidy the data (e.g., HoNOS) -->
<!-- A whole new layer is our dashboards, that use all of the necessary packages mentioned already + special packages developed specifically to support the dashboards with helper functions -->

IDEAS!!

```


## Simplified example

Imagine we're working with a database called `SystmTwo` `(S2)` and need to use two different tables for our analysis:

- `[S2].[contacts]`: Information about contacts with XXX
- `[S2].[demographics]`: Some demographic information

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)
library(RSQLite)
```

### Create example data

```{r}
# Set up example contacts table
contacts <- tibble(client_id = c(1, 1, 1, 2), 
                   contact_id = c(123, 124, 125, 156), 
                   referral_id = c(456, 459, 500, 501), 
                   referral_date = c("2018-04-19", "2019-05-23", 
                                     "2020-06-01", "2018-12-11"),
                   contact_date = c("2018-05-19", "2019-06-05", 
                                    "2020-07-08", "2019-01-15"),
                   team_id = c("tm1", "tm2", "tm1", "tm1"), 
                   hcp_id = c("hcp1", "hcp2", "hcp1", "hcp1"), 
                   contact_type = c("phone", "f2f", "video", "phone"),
                   assessment_id = c(321, 322, 344, NA))

# Set up example demographics table with 2 patients
demographics <- tibble(client_id = c(1, 2), 
                       dob = c("1988-01-01", "1965-01-01"),
                       dod = c(NA, NA),
                       sex = c("f", "m"))
```

### Create `SQLite` connection

```{r}
# Create connection (conn) to "local" database called SystmTwo (s2)
conn_s2 <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")

# Copy local data frame to conn_s2 database
db_contacts <- copy_to(conn_s2, contacts)
db_demographics <- copy_to(conn_s2, demographics)
```

### Example analysis

```{r }
# Calculate age at time of contact
db_age_at_contacts <- db_contacts %>% 
  left_join(db_demographics) %>% 
  mutate(age = today() - as.Date(dob),
         age_at_contact = contact_date - as.Date(dob)) %>% 
  select(client_id, contact_id, contact_date, dob, dod, age_at_contact)
```

### Example results

```{r, d}
db_age_at_contacts
```

### Example `SQLlite` code

```{r}
show_query(db_age_at_contacts)
```

## `nottshcsverse`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_posts/2021-08-06-nottshcverse/nottshcverse_overview_pkgs.png"))
```



### 1. Connecting with the database

<!-- After loading our packages Connecting to different databases -->

### 2. Getting some data

<!-- Getting data from different tables and views  to database -->

### 3. Tidying data

<!-- Data is a mess, and a lot of data feels like an even bigger mess -->
<!-- Tidying data so it can be analysed appropriately is an important part  -->

<!-- HoNOS R package -->

### 4. Analysing / visualising data

<!-- we want to Analyse tidy data -->

## Watch out now

<!-- - We want to build an entire universe of packages that help us AND OTHERS to understand and improve clinical care. -->

<!-- We believe that best practices from (1) open source software development and (2) open research principles from academia are the future of healthcare analytics.  -->

<!-- DOCUMENT EVERYTHING, absolutely everything! Document messy data, document tidy data, document every function, document EVERY SINGLE CHANGE (GIT FOR THE WIN AND GITHUB FOR THE WIN). -->

<!-- We work together trying to improve the service, learning more about what patients want and what could be improved ... lots more exciting stuff, small and big problems, finding more questions, and finding some answers. -->

<!-- Why do we not work together, implement similar structures for analysing code, share resources, work multidisciplinary. -->

<!-- My aim is to start a conversation about the importance of proper documenting data as well as recurring analytical tasks. -->
<!-- Moving towards a more open and shared way of working, EVERYONE wins. -->
<!-- Some people are already working like this, it's time others do it as well. -->
<!-- If not now, when then? -->
<!-- We hope others will join a more open and collaborative way of working in healthcare analytics. -->
<!-- I hope people making the decisions about the direction of healthcare analytics in the NHS will start to understand and act, hopefully soon!  -->
