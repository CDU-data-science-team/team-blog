We've been a proper data science team for a year now, 
there's [six of us](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/about.html) 
at the moment which is GREAT and we're starting to review some of the stuff that 
we've been doing to make sure that it's serving a purpose. I'm sort of writing 
this for our benefit just as a way of recording what the plan is (and to discuss 
the plan via pull request `r emojifont::emoji("sunglasses")`) but we work in the 
open so why not talk about this in the open too.

Fairly near the process we kicked off "Code review" sessions which would take place 
fortnightly and team members would bring stuff, taking it in turns to do one each. I 
hardly think I can improve on [Google's guide to code review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html) 
but I'll summarise the main points here for those who don't click through. Code review 
is the process of one or more people who have not written the code in question to 
read it and check that it's okay, before the code is merged into the codebase. Code 
reviewers are considering:

* Design
* Functionality
* Complexity
* Tests
* Good naming practices (variables, functions)
* Comments
* Style (judged against a style guide like the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/))
* Consistency
* Documentation

In the linked document Google emphasise that you should read every line- not scan 
over things and assume they're okay. It's worth remembering as well that we are 
doing data science- so we need to be reviewing statistical and ML methods as well. 
People (including me) fall into the trap of thinking that data science is just 
programming and they stop asking themselves hard questions about the methods they 
are using and that is very dangerous.

I put code review in quotes advisedly because although we went into them thinking 
we would be doing code review over the weeks and months we ended up doing something 
totally different. Sometimes we would pretty much do code review. Sometimes we would 
spend a long time discussing code style. Other times we would start off doing code 
review and end up doing an ad hoc lesson in a particular method that the person 
who came to code review. Sometimes we would have such a good time doing one of 
these things that we couldn't fit all the excitement into an hour and would call 
extraordinary code review meetings so we could carry on discussing it and not have to 
wait two weeks. 

It was pretty anarchic but we were all learning and having fun in a supportive 
environment so I thought we may as well just see where we ended up. After a year I 
thought it was time to review what we were doing around assuring our code so I 
kicked off a discussion about it which this blog post is part of. 

We have had a pretty wide ranging discussion about it and the first point of interest 
is that everybody wanted to keep the fortnightly sessions but everybody agreed that 
however awesome they were they weren't really "code review". We boiled down what 
we feel we need to four distinct activities. For the sake of brevity I will summarise 
them here- I could probably do a blog post on each and if anybody would like to 
hear more then find me on Twitter, have a look at the about page.

### Pair programming

Pair programming is what it sounds like- programming in pairs. It's a great way of 
teaching and helping each other, and solving problems together, but it's also 
a way of reviewing code too. The maxim we came up with today is simple.

> Every line of code should have been read by two people

You can do that in a pair, live, or you can do it by review (or you can do both). 
Interestingly enough the team just spontaneously started doing pair programming. 
Nobody mentioned the word, nobody asked them to. It just makes sense to do that 
so they just started doing it, which I absolutely love.

* Journal club
