We've been a proper data science team for a year now, 
there's [six of us](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/about.html) 
at the moment which is GREAT and we're starting to review some of the stuff that 
we've been doing to make sure that it's serving a purpose. I'm sort of writing 
this for our benefit just as a way of recording what the plan is (and to discuss 
the plan via pull request `r emojifont::emoji("sunglasses")` but we work in the 
open so why not talk about this in the open too.
