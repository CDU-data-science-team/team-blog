# Using templates

In `Settings` (the last tab along the top of a GitHub repository which starts Code... Issues... Pull Requests) there is now section in the `General` for issue templates. Selecting the Green button for `Set up templates` takes you to a drop down selection box saying `Add template` and select.

There are 3 templates available and all can be customised, bug report, feature request and custom template.

In the internal package the team uses we have:

* Bug report
* Feature request
* Refactor
* SQL server issue template

as the package is the link between the SQL data warehouse and R.

Every time a template is added or updated this adds a commit to the history.

# Issue tags/labels

Using the issue template you can also add the labels that are appropriate like `bug`. Our internal package mainly uses:

* bug
* database
* documentation
* duplicate
* enhancement
* question
* refactor

and one that is being used more frequently now when the issue is related to the SQL database or another package's issue `wontfix`.

For example, the package used to access the SQL database retrieves data from different databases using {dbplyr} and so if any code attempts to join the two we get the error:

```
Error in `auto_copy()`:
! `x` and `y` must share the same src.
i set `copy` = TRUE (may be slow).
```

which is related to an [issue](https://github.com/r-dbi/bigrquery/issues/219#issuecomment-703219907) that was closed in 2018 from {bigrquery}. This is referenced in the issue but with the label `wontfix` for reference. In fact, two issues have been created now!

# References to other packages

If you reference another issue from someone else's repository it will appear in their GitHub issue with the description `mentioned this issue...`.

If it's from a restricted private package only you will see the reference.
