## Introduction

[apologies this post is still in draft, I pushed it early to start discussing it with team members]

We've been using GitHub in the CDU data science team since [8th May 2020](https://github.com/CDU-data-science-team/healthcareSPC/commit/b94d1f4390b58c09fc9820afd8c5eb91ac851a15) (I think- that's the oldest commit I could find). Team members past and present have used git and GitHub to varying degrees, often solo. Data science is a team sport, without question, but like any team sport it requires proper coordination between participants to be effective. Git and GitHub are very powerful tools, but they are hard to use well even when you're collaborating just with yourself, and working well with others is another set of skills in itself. We've all made a lot of mistakes and learned a lot in the last two years, and this post is designed to codify some of this learning into a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the benefit of team members past and present. And of course, we share it for the general benefit of others who might learn something from our experiences, and also in the hope that those with more/ different skills and knowledge might be able to help us refine it further (get in touch through the usual channels :relaxed:). 

## SOP

Should cover:

* Branches (incl. gitflow- no development branch for non-packages)
* Pull requests
* Issues
* Having an owner for each repo
* Code on feature branches should be merged early and often to development. Feature branches should be merged and deleted as soon as possible
* Issues should include reprexes as much as possible https://reprex.tidyverse.org/
* Keeping data safe (DON'T put it in a git controlled repo, in the main)
* Style and linting?
* What to do if you do publish the wrong thing, incl. removing it from all branches
* Semantic versioning

## Related matters

* *Develop* code by using pkgload::load_all()
* But *run* only code installed from GitHub- otherwise different team members can be running different code bases
