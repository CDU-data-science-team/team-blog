## Introduction

[apologies this post is still in draft, I pushed it early to start discussing it with team members]

[why have an SOP, some of the issues with git and github that you only get in teams versus individuals]

## SOP

Should cover:

* Branches (incl. gitflow- no development branch for non-packages)
* Pull requests
* Issues
* Having an owner for each repo
* Code on feature branches should be merged early and often to development. Feature branches should be merged and deleted as soon as possible
* Issues should include reprexes as much as possible https://reprex.tidyverse.org/
* Keeping data safe (DON'T put it in a git controlled repo, in the main)
* Style and linting?
* What to do if you do publish the wrong thing, incl. removing it from all branches
* Semantic versioning

## Related matters

* *Develop* code by using pkgload::load_all()
* But *run* only code installed from GitHub- otherwise different team members can be running different code bases
