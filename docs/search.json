We have recently grown to five members:\r\nChris Beeley\r\nZoë Turner\r\nLori Edwards Suárez\r\nAndreas Soteriades\r\nMilan Wiedemann\r\nWe believe in open source data science and use R and Python for most of our work. We publish as much code and data as we can on our team GitHub page. We have a wide range of skills including statistics, machine learning, SQL/ data engineering, Shiny, text mining, and forecasting. We are currently working on nationally funded open source data science projects as well as a range of things within our own Trust, and in the coming weeks and months each team member will present some of this work to you. We love to collaborate, to communicate, to meet new people, and to offer (and receive!) advice and support, especially to colleagues in health and social care across the UK (and the world) so please reach out to any of us on Twitter or anywhere else you might come across us or our work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This was started in response to our need to ensure that the solutions we create are understood by everyone and that we are concentrating on the right problems.\r\nThis will be a continuous two-way discussion facilitated by the CDU Data Science Team and will also include analysts from Applied Information and Performance.\r\nThe Understanding Your Data also links into the initiative of Data Clinics where particular specific support has been given to teams with their data. This has been facilitated by our Clinical Analyst.\r\nInitial request\r\nAre you interested in understanding your data better?\r\nDo you have questions about what is going on in your service you feel like you currently can’t answer?\r\nDo you have ideas for ways of presenting and understanding data that you don’t have the time to make a reality?\r\nWould you be interested in looking at data, analyses, and dashboards and feeding back your opinions about them?\r\nApplied Information and the Clinical Development Unit work together to collate, process, and analyse all sorts of datasets for national reporting as well as internal analysis, audit, evaluation, and research. We are trying to make sense of the data in the Trust but we need to hear from people out in services who can tell us what they want and don’t want, and can look at analytic products that we make and give us feedback on them.\r\nIf you’re interested in being a part of the way that the Trust develops its tools for analysing data there are lots of ways you can be involved- coming to a workshop, testing tools in your own time and feeding back your opinions, coming with your own ideas about tools or analyses you would like to see or just commenting on our plans and helping to shape the future of what we produce.\r\nCDU Data Science Roadmap\r\nThe video of the presentation by Chris Beeley is viewable in on the Trust’s Microsoft Stream site: https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/41df2da8-eac3-4391-8e0c-a4ef0a853688?list=studio (will require an authorised log in).\r\nThemes from the events\r\nTraining\r\nTraining was something we hadn’t considered but came up as a theme. Analysts main software tools are Excel, PowerBI, SQL and R.\r\nR\r\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust allows all staff to access R and R Studio for download through the Software Centre (accessible through the Windows Start button).\r\nTraining is offered through NHS-R Community every month. The course is led by Zoë Turner. Course materials are available here.\r\nShiny training is being offered through NHS-R Community and is being designed and led by Chris Beeley. Course materials are available here and specifically for beginners.\r\nHelp for R can be sought from the Slack channel nhsrcommunity.slack.com. Also note that there is a Government Data Science Slack channel govdatascience.slack.com but access to this is restricted to certain email addresses like nhs.net and not individual Trust accounts.\r\nMapping\r\nAnother general interest that came from the group was mapping data and tools used for this are often QGIS. This is also available through the Software Centre but specific access may be required through IT.\r\nPublic Health Mapping tools\r\nThere are a couple of Public Health mapping tools that are available and more information can be found here:\r\nData clinics\r\nSome individual pieces of work have come out of the Understanding your data meeting and have moved into the data clinic initiative discussed more here\r\nPatient Feedback\r\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust’s Patient Feedback (including Care Opinion information) can be found here.\r\nMeeting dates\r\nTo try to accommodate as many diaries as possible the day of the meeting will change each month and always be at the same time (1130-1230):\r\nTues 2nd March\r\nWed 7th April\r\nThurs 6th May\r\nFri 4th June\r\nTo book on the meeting which will be on MS Teams, please email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
